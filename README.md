# Fly.io Distributed Systems Challenge

Series of distributed system challenges, from unique ID generation to asynchronous consensus. Attempted in Go.

## Getting Started

### Running the Code
To run the code, Go, [Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom) and its dependencies are required. [Download](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/releases) the Maelstrom binary and untar it in the root directory of this project as below:
```
├── maelstrom
├── maelstrom-echo
├── maelstrom-unique-ids
└── ...(more)
```
Each subdirectory corresponds to a challenge section. The code can be run by executing `run.sh` included in each section.
